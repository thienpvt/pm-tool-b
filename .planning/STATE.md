# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-07)

**Core value:** Every project-scoped request is tenant-isolated and every layer has one job — so a new route or page cannot silently reintroduce IDOR or a 2000-line god component.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Test Harness

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Test Harness)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-08-07 — Roadmap created, 7 phases mapped to 52 v1 requirements (100% coverage)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: bottom-up layer order settled by dependency, not preference — repositories → integrations → services → route thinning → enforcement rollout → UI. Do not reorder.
- Roadmap: access enforcement split into two phases (5: build wrapper, 6: roll out) specifically to allow shadow-mode logging before hard enforcement, avoiding a 403 storm.
- Roadmap: HYG-01/02/03 treated as cross-cutting execution conventions applying to every phase, not a standalone phase.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Whether `proxy.ts` executes in the deployed Docker runtime is unconfirmed (ROUTE-11, Phase 6) — treat as open, do not build route-level enforcement as if it depends on proxy.ts working.
- Credential resolver unification (Phase 3, INTG-07/08) risks silently breaking a tenant's Jira or Anthropic config if precedence order changes — verify every configured company before deleting old paths.
